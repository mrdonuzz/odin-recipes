Odin Recipes

This project is a part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The main objective is to practice and reinforce the HTML knowledge acquired throughout the course.

Introduction

In this project, we will build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. While the website might not look aesthetically pleasing at this stage, the primary focus is on building a strong foundation in HTML. We will revisit this project in the future to enhance its design with CSS.

Setting Up the Project's GitHub Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub.com named odin-recipes and choose the public option.
Clone the repository onto your local machine, preferably inside a repos folder.
Navigate to the odin-recipes directory on your local machine.
Set up this README.md file and provide a brief introduction about the project and the skills demonstrated upon its completion.

Assignment

Iteration 1: Initial Structure

Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
Populate it with standard boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.

Iteration 2: Recipe Page

Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
Inside the recipes directory, create a new HTML file named after the recipe it will contain (e.g., lasagna.html).
For now, the recipe page should contain an h1 heading with the recipe's name.
In the index.html file, add a link to the newly created recipe page.

Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

The new recipe page should have:

An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading.
A "Description" heading followed by a brief description of the recipe.
An "Ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list of ingredients.
A "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the cooking steps.

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

Add two more recipes with the same structure as the first recipe page.
Link the new recipes on the main index page.
